I am a third year PhD student at the University of Manchester studying category theory and its relation to logic, supervised by [Nicola Gambino](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/nicola.gambino/).  

My research centres around topics in internal category theory, $2$-topos theory, type theory, constructive logic and the intersection of these things.

I started out by constructing a model structure on the category of categories internal to an arithmetic $\Pi$-pretopos; this restricts to a model structure on the category of internal groupoids which forms a model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory (MLTT). When the category in question is the category of sets, this recovers Hofmann and Streicher's groupoidal model of MLTT, and gives a constructive proof of this and the existence of a model structure on $\mathbf{Cat}$. 

I am also interested in $2$-dimensional categorical foundations of mathematics. In work with [Adrian Miranda](https://adriantosharmiranda.github.io/) on [The Elementary Theory of the 2-Category of Small Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03647), we extend Lawvere's elementary theory of the category of sets to a 2-dimensional setting. This gives an axiomatisation of the $2$-category of small categories. 

In an attempt to axiomatise instead the $2$-category of locally small categories, we look at a $2$-dimensional reformulation of Joyal and Moerdijk's Class Categories, which axiomatise the category of classes in contrast to an elementary topos, which aims to axiomatise the category of sets. This $2$-dimensional reformulation gives a suitable environment for talking about a $2$-category with a well-behaved class of "small" objects. Our motivating example is the category of locally small categories, for which the small objects are the small categories. 

I completed an MMath in Mathematics at the university of Sheffield in 2022. My MMath project was on the Dold-Kan correspondence, supervised by Prof. Sarah Whitehouse.
