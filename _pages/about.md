I am a first year PhD student at the University of Manchester studying model category theory and its relation to homotopy type theory, supervised by Dr. Nicola Gambino.  My current work is defining a constructive model structure on internal groupoids in a countably lextensive category. 

I completed an MMath in Mathematics at the university of Sheffield in 2022.
