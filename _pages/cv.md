[A PDF of my CV.](calum-hughes.github.io/files/CV 2022.pdf) Below is the short version.

Education
======
* First Class honours MMath in Mathematics, the University of Sheffield 2022.
   * Masters project: "The Dold-Kan Correspondence", supervised by Prof. Sarah Whitehouse.

Work experience
======
* Summer 2020: Undergraduate Research Internship.
* Project title: "Simplicial Sets"
  * The University of Sheffield
  * This was a competitive position funded by the School of Mathematics and Statistics, and involved directed reading and working out some new examples of a classifying space of a group by myself.
  * Supervisor: Dr. James Brotherston

* Summer 2021: Undergraduate Research Internship.
* Project title: "Dynamics of Linear Operators: Limit Sets in Finite Dimensions''
  * The London Mathematical Society
  * This was a competitive UK-wide place to research a 2-month project. It involved using Python to make conjectures about pure maths, and then finding techniques to prove these conjectures about the limiting behaviour of linear operators on finite dimensional space.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Dimitrios Roxanas
