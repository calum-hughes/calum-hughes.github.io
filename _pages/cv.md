[A PDF of my CV.](https://calum-hughes.github.io/files/CV2022.pdf) Below is the shorter, but likely more up-to-date version.

Education
======
* Second Year PhD student under the supervision of Dr. Nicola Gambino.
   * Project Title: "The Effective Model Structure and $\infty$-groupoid objects in homotopy type theory".
   * Courses taken: Category Theory, Set Theory, Homological Algebra, Languages and Groups, Representation Theory of Groups, Model Theory.
  
* First Class honours MMath in Mathematics, the University of Sheffield 2022.
   * Masters project: "The Dold-Kan Correspondence", supervised by Prof. Sarah Whitehouse.


Work experience
======
* Summer 2020: Undergraduate Research Internship.
* Project title: "Simplicial Sets"
  * The University of Sheffield
  * This was a competitive position funded by the School of Mathematics and Statistics, and involved directed reading and working out some new examples of a classifying space of a group by myself.
  * Supervisor: Dr. James Brotherston

* Summer 2021: Undergraduate Research Internship.
* Project title: "Dynamics of Linear Operators: Limit Sets in Finite Dimensions''
  * The London Mathematical Society
  * This was a competitive UK-wide place to research a 2-month project. It involved using Python to make conjectures about pure maths, and then finding techniques to prove these conjectures about the limiting behaviour of linear operators on finite dimensional space.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Dimitrios Roxanas

Organisational Activities
======

* Mathematics Students' Research Conference 2023 (29/09/2023) --- I was on the organisational committee for this conference which had over 60 attendants. The organisation involved sourcing Â£1500 funding from two institutes (Heilbronn Institute of Pure Mathematics and The University of Manchester School of Mathematics), organising catering, speakers and a poster session.


* Students' Logic Seminar, The University of Manchester --- This is a weekly seminar that runs in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester intended for PhD students in logic. 

* Topos Theory Reading Group --- I co-organise a weekly reading group for topos theory.

Outreach
======


* I was part of the academic panel for [MIMUC 2024](https://mimucmanchester.wixsite.com/mimuc-2024), the Manchester Interdisciplinary Mathematics Undergraduate Conference. This involved answering students' questions about academia and PhD life. 
* In 2022 and 2023, I gave feedback on 30 minute talks that Manchester Masters' students gave in preparation for the presentation component of their Masters' Project module.
* 2022- I have made departmental coffee every Monday...
