A 30 minute hybrid talk/ mathematical activity in which I explained the maths behind the recent paper by David Cushing and David I. Stewart titled "[You need 27 tickets to guarantee a win on the UK National Lottery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12430)"

This was an event for the MRSC 2023, which I was organising with 3 others. The event had 60 people attend.
