We give an elementary description of $2$-categories
$\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)$ of internal categories, functors and
natural transformations, where $\mathcal{E}$ is a category modelling Lawvere's
elementary theory of the category of sets (ETCS). This extends Bourke's
characterisation of $2$-categories $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)$ where
$\mathcal{E}$ has pullbacks to take account for the extra properties in ETCS,
and Lawvere's characterisation of the (one dimensional) category of small
categories to take account of the two-dimensional structure. Important
two-dimensional concepts which we introduce include $2$-well-pointedness,
full-subobject classifiers, and the categorified axiom of choice. Along the
way, we show how generating families (resp. orthogonal factorisation systems)
on $\mathcal{E}$ give rise to generating families (resp. orthogonal
factorisation systems) on $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)_{1}$, results
which we believe are of independent interest.
